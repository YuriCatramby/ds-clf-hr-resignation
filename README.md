# Employee Turnover Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an employee will resign from a company or not. The prediction of resignations is a critical issue for organizations, as high employee turnover can have serious consequences for the work environment and the financial health of the company.

## Impact of Employee Turnover

High employee turnover can bring various problems to companies, such as:

1. **Increased Costs**: Hiring and training new employees can be costly, especially if it is a frequent process due to high turnover.

2. **Lack of Engagement and Productivity**: Employees who see colleagues constantly leaving the company may become demotivated and less engaged in their tasks.

3. **Management Issues**: High turnover rates can be a sign of problems in management or the work environment, which can negatively affect team morale and efficiency.

4. **Impact on Organizational Culture**: Constant turnover can compromise the culture and stability of the company, affecting team cohesion.

## Solution with Machine Learning

Using machine learning to predict resignations can bring several benefits to companies:

1. **Early Problem Detection**: With an accurate model, the company can identify employees at risk of resignation before it occurs, allowing for preventive actions.

2. **Resource Optimization**: By identifying the factors that contribute most to turnover, the company can direct efforts to improve those specific areas.

3. **Workplace Improvement**: Based on the insights provided by the model, the company can implement policies and practices that promote a more satisfying and engaging work environment.

4. **Financial Resource Savings**: Reducing employee turnover leads to significant savings in hiring and training costs.

## Conclusion

Predicting resignations through machine learning is a valuable tool for companies seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of high employee turnover. By identifying patterns and risk factors, organizations can implement proactive strategies to maintain an engaged and productive team, resulting in both financial and cultural benefits.
